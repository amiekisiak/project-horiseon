# <Project-Horiseon>

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the existing code to make webpage more accesible. This was achieved by adding semantic HTML elements to the source code and adding descriptive tags to all images. 

Also, the Scout Rule was followed to ensure that the code is cleaner and more organised than previously. Repeating CSS selectors were also combined into one class.
